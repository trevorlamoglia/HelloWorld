# Overview

This is my hello world program. My intent was to learn and hone my skills in programming as a software engineer and to further improve my skills in my career. The first step towards this goal is executing "Hello World" in python.

This software is usually the first program that new coders learn. Even those with little or no experience can execute Hello World easily.

Hello world, traditionally is used to illustrate how the process of coding works, as well as to ensure that a language or system is operating correctly.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
